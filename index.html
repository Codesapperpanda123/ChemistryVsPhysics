	  <p> The alien shows many new traits and abilities that protect it in the harsh weather of the tundra.</p>
	  <h1>Defencive adaptations</h1>
	  <p>The alien has developed a snowy blue fur that helps to blend in with the snow covered ground and keeps the alien warm. It also has gained a large increase in speed due to its strengthened hind legs.</p>
	  <h2>Other Adaptations</h2>
	  <p>The alien also learned to pack with other organisms to become harder to deal with</p>
	  <h1>Competition</h1>
	  <p>This alien tends to compete with arctic seals over salmon. Though the alien tends to migrate if seals are within the area, unless if the alien’s pack had been there first. In which the aliens would slaughter the seals in attempt to protect their salmon.</p>
	  <h1>Relationships</h1>
	  <p>The alien tends to have relationships with other species in the tundra</p>
	  <h3>Mutualitic Relationships</h3>
	  <h3>Comenalistic Relationships</h3>
		  <p>Arctic foxes tend to scavenge food from other predators, not much has changed with the alien. Any salmon left over from the alien is consumed by the arctic foxes</p>
	  <h3>Parasitic Relationships</h3> 
		  <p>A flea tends to make it into the alien’s fur, as with most animals with fur. The flea then proceeds to hide within the fur to stay warm and suck blood from the alien.</p>
