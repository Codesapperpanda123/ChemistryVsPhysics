    <h1>But first we must find out what it should evolve into</h1>
    <h1> The Biome </h1>
    <h2><b>Tundra:</b></h2>
    <h3>Biotic Factors:</h3>
   
        <ul>
		<p>Arctic foxes</p>
		<p>Ravens</p>
	  	<p>Salmon</p>
		<p>Caribou</p>
		<p>Arctic Hare</p>
		<p>Various Grasses</p>
		<p>Various Shrubs</p>
		<p>Arctic Willow</p>
		<p>Lichen</p>
		<p>Tufted Saxifrage</p>
      	</ul>
    
    <h3>Abiotic Factors:</h3>
    
        <ul>
	    	<p>Soil</p>
		<p>Permafrwost</p>
		<p>Strong Winds</p>
		<p>Low Temperatures</p>

    <h3>Intresting facts about the tundra</h3>
	  
		  <ul>
			  <p>Some of the coldest places in the world are tundras. However, Antarctica (the coldest place in the world) is a desert.</p>
			  <p>Tundras tend to have low biotic diversity</p>
			  <p>Tundras have six week summers(cold ones at that), with 24 hours of sunlight every day.</p>
		  </ul>
	  
    <h1>Now that we know what the environment is, we can determine that he should be able to survive in the cold, and should have strong teeth so that it can hunt it's prey</h1>
    <h2> What does the alien finally evolve into</h2>

	  <p> The alien shows many new traits and abilities that protect it in the harsh weather of the tundra.</p>
	  <h1>Defencive adaptations</h1>
	  <p>The alien has developed a snowy blue fur that helps to blend in with the snow covered ground and keeps the alien warm. It also has gained a large increase in speed due to its strengthened hind legs.</p>
	  <h2>Other Adaptations</h2>
	  <p>The alien also learned to pack with other organisms to become harder to deal with</p>
	  <h1>Competition</h1>
	  <p>This alien tends to compete with arctic seals over salmon. Though the alien tends to migrate if seals are within the area, unless if the alien’s pack had been there first. In which the aliens would slaughter the seals in attempt to protect their salmon.</p>
	  <h1>Relationships</h1>
	  <p>The alien tends to have relationships with other species in the tundra</p>
	  <h3>Mutualitic Relationships</h3>
	  <p>This new alien species has a mutualistic relationship with micro-organisms inside it, which break down plants because the alien can't, and the alien provides shelter and vegetation for this micro-organism</p>
	  <h3>Comenalistic Relationships</h3>
		  <p>Arctic foxes tend to follow polar bears and scavenge extra food. This is the same with the new alien that has evolved. It eats all of the scraps that the polar bear leaves behind</p>
	  <h3>Parasitic Relationships</h3> 
		  <p>A flea tends to make it into the alien’s fur, as with most animals with fur. The flea then proceeds to hide within the fur to stay warm and suck blood from the alien</p>
	  <h1>What about the local habitats?</h1>
	  <p>Arctic foxes tend to burrow into the hilsides and riverbanks of the tundra</p>
	  <p>Caribou tend to live in nearby forests and mountains, and migrate to the tundra in the summer<p>
	  <h2>What about the alien?</h2>
	  <p>The alien burrows under deep snow near a river or lake.</p>
